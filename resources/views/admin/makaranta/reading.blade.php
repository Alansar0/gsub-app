                ignifiers are the most important addition to the chapter, a concept first introduced in my book
                <span class="italic text-[#58a6ff]">Living with Complexity.</span> The first edition had a focus upon
                affordances, but although affordances make sense for interaction with physical objects, they are confusing
                when dealing with virtual ones. As a result, affordances have created much confusion in the world of
                design. Affordances define what actions are possible. Signifiers specify how people discover those
                possibilities: signifiers are signs, perceptible signals of what can be done.

            <p class="mt-4 text-[#f0f6fc]/85 text-justify">
                Signifiers are far more important to designers than are affordances. Hence, the extended treatment.
                I added a very brief section on HCD, a short treatment absent even in the first edition. I also
                pushed, albeit without luck before, to see that the entire book was about HCD. Other than that,
                the chapter is the same.
